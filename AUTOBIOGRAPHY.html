            <h1>Hi there!</h1>
            <p> My name is Cheilou, and you can call me Chei for short. 
            I'm the oldest daughter in my family and currently a 19-year-old 1st-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Lyceum of the Philippines University-Cavite.
            <br><br>
            A bit about me — I absolutely love engaging in deep conversations. Having someone to talk to about life in general is my kind of thing.
            These kinds of conversations, whether it's delving into personal experiences or engaging in philosophical discussions,
            helps me comprehend the world more fully!
            <br><br> 
            <a class="link-offset-2 link-underline link-underline-opacity-0" href="https://m.me/CheilouMarie">I'm always up for a conversation</a> if you have an interest in thought-provoking dialogues!

            <h1>Home and Heart</h1>
            <p>    My family means the world to me, and everything I'm doing right now is for them.
                Success isn't merely a dream but a tangible goal; I want to give my parents a life they never thought possible.
                <br><br>
                I also have a younger brother, three years apart from me. We argue sometimes, like all siblings do, but he's also my go-to person like a human diary. 
                When we team up, I feel like there's nothing we can't do. We're like Mabel and Dipper from Gravity Falls. 
                He's the best, and I wouldn't ask for anything more. 
                <br><br>
                If there's such a thing as reincarnation, <u>I would willingly embrace any path that will lead me back to them.</u>

            <h1>Pastime Pleasures</h1>
            <p> My definition of 'fun' isn't getting wasted but doing various hobbies.
                I prefer keeping these aspects of my life private as I'm not a fan of people prying into my business.
                <br><br>
                One hobby I love is airsoft. Even though the bullets can hurt, the experience and excitement in each game are amazing. Right now, we have a 12-gauge shotgun, M415 rifle, sniper rifle, and a 1911 pistol.
                <br><br>
                I used to go to the gym when I was diagnosed with atelectasis, but things got busier. So, my dad got me some dumbbells for home workouts. Not to brag, but I find solving Rubik's cubes really cool. I can do 2x2, 3x3, pyraminx, megamix, and mirror cube. I hope to learn 4x4 soon!
                Building Lego sets is another fun thing, especially when you're enjoying the process. 
                <br><br>
                And lastly, my absolute favorite is taking care of my lovebirds. They're my number one and the most precious things in my world.

            <h1>A Night with BLACKPINK</a></h1>
            <p> I remember creating a fan account with my friends in 2016 dedicated to them — you can still find it on Instagram haha. 
                Watching them perform live is truly magical. The way the crowd roars when they come out is a once-in-a-blue-moon experience. 
                The Blinks, Blackpink fans, were shouting, cheering, screaming, barking LOL, dancing, crying — 
                being there to witness all of it is overwhelming. It's like a karaoke party with everyone singing along to every song. 
                They were one of the best parts of my 2023, and I hope to see them again at the next concert.
                <br><br>
                Blackpink also has fun personalities, they're smart, love to help people, and are very gentle with their fans. 
                My bias, Jennie, once said, "<i>Make sure that you do something that you will be happy with when you go back and look at yourself.</i>"
                She's so real for that.

            <h1>Classmates to Bestmates</h1>
            <p>One of the main highlights of my life is my journey with the 12-Genesis batch '22-'23. 
                These people have profoundly influenced my viewpoint on life. Crab mentality was never in our dictionary; we uplifted each other, 
                and I am proud to say that all 36 students graduated with honors and high honors.
                I also served as an officer in Citizenship Advancement Training, 
                where one of the most important aspects taught to us was discipline, and it's something I carry with me until now.
                <br><br>
                Doing research was genuinely fun. Instead of practicing for the research defense, we literally played with airsoft guns, like actual 'defense.' 
                It's a fun memory to recall. We gathered some candles, found an eagle statue somewhere, and chanted, 'Research cutie, defended kami,' 
                three times before preparing for our actual research defense.
                <br><br>
                My OG friends, the 'Open the Frog,' my Tagaytay buddies, and 'Tropapeeps' are my safe haven. 
                They're truly the best people out there. I love discussing the future with them. 
                They don't shame or call you 'boring' when you always study; instead, they're happy to have a friend like you. 
                <u>They know how to have 'fun' without getting wasted, and I'll forever love them for that.</u> 
                We even have this inside joke about 'magpapa-utang' if one of us wins the lottery someday.</p>

        <h1>The Art of Journalism</h1>
        <p>Honestly, with sports writing, the 'writing' part isn't necessarily the fun one, 
            but the moments when we have to cover sports from different areas. 
            Watching players display full determination and a will to win is genuinely pleasing to the eyes. 
            Whether it's a heart-stopping rally, a barnburner gameplay, or the exhilarating feeling when our school clinches gold, 
            those moments are unforgettable. I am also forever grateful for my sportswriter buddy, Kyle; 
            he definitely made my last years in journalism exciting and fun.
            <br><br>
            Our advisor and trainer in journalism, Teacher Flor, treated us like her own kids. 
            I may have failed her a lot of times, but her faith in me never have failed me.
            <br><br>
            Reflecting on my three-year journey in journalism, I've learned two things: 
            to live within the moment and to follow the three Es—'Enjoy, Excel, and Explore.</p>

        <h1>Messages Across Time</h1>
        <p>Are you familiar with the site 'Future Letters'? Because it's genuinely my favorite! 
            From its name, writing future letters for myself is my kind of love. It's like tracking my journey and progress in life: 
            the lessons I've learned, motivational quotes, and seeing how far I've come. 
            I used to have a pretty complicated coping mechanism, <strike>hurting myself in unimaginable ways </strike>, which I am aware isn't great at all. 
            Fortunately, my aunt saw it; she and her husband are the only ones who know about it, and we kinda got into an agreement on 
            how I am coping with things. They were very patient with me, and I am proud to say that I am 10 months clean!

            <u>With a yearning to change, I started writing future letters to motivate myself.</u> I still need to read these letters, 
            so I have to keep living for the life I want. It's kind of like a reminder that I'm an alive person with a blank canvas, 
            given a chance to choose how to paint my life the way I desire. The letter you see is from my June 26, 2022, self which is an another
            highlight of my life.

        <h1>Against the Odds</h1>
        <p>
            The letter I shared earlier marked one of my lowest points in life. It made me realize that we never really know what 
            can happen to us today or even the next day. Often, <i>we take advantage of life instead of truly living it.</i>
            <br><br>
            In 2021, when I was diagnosed with PTB and a mass in my right hilar region, my world crumbled. 
            The regret I felt was immense. While I acknowledged I had done things to harm my body, 
            the thought of dying was never in my vocabulary; 
            it was just a way to transform the immense emotional pain I was experiencing into physical pain, a pain that could heal.
            <br><br>
            Remembering that I still had future letters to read, I refused to let this sickness get the best of me. 
            I underwent a 6-month treatment, and after a year, it left behind fibrosis or scars, symbolic of the battle I fought hard to win.
            
            Just two weeks ago, during my annual checkup, I had another x-ray, and the result showed 'unremarkable'—like an instant miracle.
            I consider this experience a blessing in disguise because it opened my eyes to live my life to the fullest 
            and never take it for granted.

        <p>There will be moments when you think you will never recover from. But life always seems to go on. Things could be different in a few days,
            weeks, or months, and in the end, it's worth sticking around to find out.        
            <br><br>
            Always remember that you never really lose in life. You make the right decision, and sometimes, you make the decision right.
            Consistency pays off eventually; so keep going, and be patient with the person you are becoming.
            Live in every moment, cherish every experience, and leave your indelible <i>footprints</i> on the sands of time. 
            Life, regardless of its duration, is a canvas waiting for our stories to unfold. 
            So, let's embrace each chapter, savor every line, and make our <i>existence</i> a masterpiece - a testament to the beauty of living within the <b>Footprints of Existence</b>.</p>
